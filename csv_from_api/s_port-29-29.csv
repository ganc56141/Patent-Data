The detection method includes determining whether or not a message sent out onto the network is an attack message, saving information relating to the attack message in at least one memory in a case where the message is an attack message, identifying a communication pattern from information relating to the attack message, and determining whether or not the message matches a communication pattern. The determination of whether an attack message and determination of whether matching a communication pattern are executed on each of a plurality of messages received from the network. In the determining of whether an attack message executed on a message received after executing of determining of whether matching a communication pattern, results of the determination of whether an attack message that has already be executed are used.",PANASONIC INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CORPORATION OF AMERICA,2021-03-08,H04L29/06,US17194514,US20210194902A1,2021-06-24,Manabu MAEDA; Takeshi KISHIKAWA; Daisuke KUNIMUNE,企业,H04L29/06; B60R16/023; G06F21/55,,/docs/US/2021-06-24/US20210194902A1/abs.jpg.150x150.jpg

The system implements a near-real-time method of detecting activity corresponding to particular electronic health records associated with particular patients in third-party systems using specifically configured software systems. A cloud-based micro-services architecture is communicably coupled to the third-party systems and is operable to transmit contextually relevant data to the third-party system in response to particular detected activities, such as accessing a patient's electronic health record. The contextually-relevant data is identified by comparing electronic health record data from various third-party systems, each third-party system associated with the particular patient, to determine gaps in the records. The contextually relevant data is transmitted to the third-party system and visually integrated into the third-party system's pre-existing clinical workflow.",SNAPS Solutions LLC,2021-03-08,G16H10/60,US17194426,US20210193277A1,2021-06-24,"Robert Emmitt Connely, IV; Bryant Paul Castleton; James Tropauer; Saurabh Mathur",企业,G16H10/60; G06F16/26; G06F16/27; H04W12/02; G16H40/67; G16H20/00; H04L29/08; G06Q40/08; G06Q10/06; G16H40/20; G16H40/63; G16B20/10; G16H30/20; G16H20/10,,/docs/US/2021-06-24/US20210193277A1/abs.jpg.150x150.jpg
