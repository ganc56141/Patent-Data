The wiring board is rotatably secured to the main body member through the fitting between the positioning hole and the projecting portion. A terminal of a battery segment connector is formed of a conductive material having elasticity, and the housing of the battery segment connector is movable relatively to the wiring board without coming into contact with the wiring board. The distance from the positioning hole to the external connection terminal is shorter than the distance from the positioning hole to the battery segment connector.",
